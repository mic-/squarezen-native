/*
0000-CFFF - RAM.
D000-D0FF - GTIA chip mirrored 8 times. ASAP maps just the PAL register at D014 for NTSC/PAL detection and the CONSOL register at D01F for 1-bit sounds, the rest is RAM.
D100-D1FF - reserved for parallel devices connected to the Atari, do not use.
D200-D2FF - POKEY chip mirrored 16 times or two POKEY chips (stereo) mirrored 8 times. At least the AUDF1-4, AUDC1-4 and AUDCTL registers must be implemented in a SAP player. Emulation of timer interrupts via IRQEN and IRQST is strongly recommended. SAP by Adam Bienias emulates only timer 1 interrupts.
D300-D3FF - reserved for the PIA chip, do not use.
D400-D4FF - ANTIC chip mirrored 16 times. SAP files may rely on WSYNC (D40A) and VCOUNT (D40B) registers. ASAP also implements NMIST/NMIRES (D40F), but not NMIEN (D40E). The playback routine should be driven by the PLAYER/FASTPLAY mechanism instead of directly programming ANTIC interrupts.
D500-D5FF - reserved for cartridge, do not use.
D600-D6FF - COVOX chip if enabled via the COVOX tag (ASAP only). The COVOX consists of four unsigned 8-bit DACs: 0 and 3 for the left channel, 1 and 2 for the right channel.
D700-D7FF - reserved for expansions, do not use.
D800-FFFF - RAM. FFFE/FFFF is 6502â€™s interrupt vector for POKEY timer interrupts.
